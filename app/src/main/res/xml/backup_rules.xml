   Sample backup rules that drive the Android Backup Service.

   The `<include>` and `<exclude>` elements are used to specify what data should
   be backed up. The order of these elements matters: they are processed from
   top to bottom, and the first matching rule wins.

   By default, all files in the application's private directory are backed up,
   except for the `no_backup` and `cache` directories. This file is a placeholder
   for more specific rules if needed.

    TODO: Use <include> and <exclude> to control what data is backed up.
    For example, to back up all shared preferences, uncomment the following:
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
    To exclude a specific shared preference, specify its name:
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="my_sensitive_preference.xml"/>
